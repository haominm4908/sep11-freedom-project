### Tool
For my Freedom Project tool, I've went through some options, and saw what could work. I landed with gDevelop for my tool, as it aligened with my use case. Prior to choosing the tool, I tinkered around with it. When I say tinkering around, I mean messing around with the models. Sure I can make a function in the tool that I'm using, but I lack knowledge on how to apply that function to the tools models and other stuff. The hard part was actually how to figure out the models. I've tinkered with another game engine, Unity, and it's modeling that was somewhat straight forward. As for gDevelop, it might be just me whos struggling how to figure out the models. The physics engine behaviors work perfectly, the models have been a little setback on for me while learning the tool.

### Goal
My goal is to make a First person 3D Platformer. That sounds vague, but what I had in mind is something similar to the game [Clustertruck](https://store.steampowered.com/app/397950/Clustertruck/). As a matter of fact, Clustertruck was wat inspired me to take this kind of route for my idea for my FP this year. It has this silly, yet challenging feel to it. Adding on with the fast-paced nature of the game makes it even better. So my idea was something similar to that, except it uses hard obstacles rather than trucks as it's maing thing. I plan to use gDevelop for this as it

### EDP
For the EDP of this tool, I plan to make a small version of a parkour course. Just one level as too many would leave most levels being unpolished and varying in quality. My Idea of this is an intermediate course, as it allows me to plan out the easier levels while also brainstorming harder levels as well.

### Skills
Skills that I picked up, or starting to pick up from this is how to tinker with all sorts of stuff of a tool, and also learning what circumstances tools would be best used for. It is better to understand a tool that you know would be ideal for your situation rather than using a tool that is a bit unfulfilling to your goal. A great example is what my original thoughts on what my tool should be. I initially wanted to do three.js for my FP, but after doing some digging, it is NOT suitable for my use case. Three.js is not a game engine, but acts as an aseet libary used for animations. This would be great if I my project was an animation. While yes it is possible to make a game out of three.js, it is VERY consuming as i have to combine it with a JS physics game engine which I then have to figure out how to combine the two. So yes, choosing the right tool and learning about it and it's best use case is very important.
